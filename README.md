2. Solution of all types of serifs and assessment of their accuracy
3. Basic geodesy tasks (example: inverse geodetic task)
4. Applied geodesy tasks (example: perpendicular baseline)
5. Higher geodesy tasks (7 elements of Helmert)
```
Also present:
```
1. Reading TLE format
2. Some problems from geometry
3. Each constructed traverse or serifs can be displayed in a separate window for clarity of the result 
```
